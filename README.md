```

Then:

REPOS = "balvig/hub_store,balvig/hub_link"

HubStore::Importer.new(repos: REPOS, start_date: 4.weeks.ago).run
# => Imports pull request and review data to a local sqlite DB

HubStore::Exporter.new(resource: PullRequest).run
# => Exports pull request data from sqlite DB to `pull_requests.csv`

HubStore::Exporter.new(resource: Review).run
# => Exports review data from sqlite DB to `reviews.csv`
```

### Using from command line (WIP)

```bash
gem install hub_store
OCTOKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token> hub_store <github_organization/repo_name>
# => Exports 2 years worth of PRs/Reviews to csv files
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
