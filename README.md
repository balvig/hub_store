# Hub Store

Save raw pull request and review metadata from GitHub for metrics
analysis etc.

## Usage

Running the following will export all PR/Review metadata in a repo to CSV

The gem will use an sqlite db as interim storage to allow resuming and
subsequent exports:

```bash
gem install hub_store

```
